Picture this: developers roasting AI, merch flying through the air, chaotic laughter echoing off the walls, just another Friday night in techland. Somewhere between a sarcastic burn and a bro-handshake, I ended up with the official <span style="color: #3b82f6;"><em>"10x Developer"</em></span> merch and a pic with the bros. But as I walked away still laughing, something tugged at me, quietly, annoyingly:</p>\n\n    <p><span style="color: #3b82f6;"><strong>When was the last time I actually built something?</strong></span></p>\n\n    <p>Weirdly, I couldn\'t even remember the last time I felt that rush: building for the sake of building. No Jira, no sprints, no calendar pings. Just me, an idea, and that chaos-fueled dopamine hit. Not tweaking some UI elements or fixing bugs. I mean actually sitting down with a blank screen. Feeling clueless, slightly terrified, slipping into existential crisis, yet oddly excited about turning a random thought into something real. Honestly, it had been a while.</p>\n\n    <p>A few days later, I was wandering around the World Trade Center, channeling equal parts <span style="color: #3b82f6;"><em>Gossip Girl</em></span> and <span style="color: #3b82f6;"><em>Silicon Valley</em></span>. Overdressed, overthinking, and quietly wondering if my morning routine needed a pitch deck. Everyone around me looked like they had just come from an investor meeting or were on their way to disrupt something. That\'s when it hit me:</p>\n\n    <p><span style="color: #3b82f6;"><em><strong>I need to build something. It\'s been a while. But… what?</strong></em></span></p>\n\n    <p>Of course, my first instinct was to turn to my new best friend, ChatGPT. A few prompts in, I noticed something mildly concerning: I was venting way more than coding. I figured I should probably channel that emotional energy into a product, before GPT flagged me as <span style="color: #3b82f6;"><em>"chronically sentimental"</em></span>. Also, I was genuinely curious to see what this whole AI agent hype was all about. I mean, was I about to build a moody version of Alexa with trust issues? Probably not, but close enough.</p>\n\n    <p>Of course I install <span style="color: #3b82f6;"><strong>Cursor</strong></span>, I opened it and stared at the blank screen, and I officially joined the new trendy club: "vibe coding." No roadmap, no plan, just pure vibes and dangerously optimistic confidence. The kind of <span style="color: #3b82f6;"><em>"let\'s go with the flow"</em></span> that, for once, doesn\'t ghost you three weeks later with commitment issues <span style="color: #3b82f6;"><em>(Personal attack? Maybe)</em></span>.</p>\n\n    <p>And honestly? It felt great. The adrenaline rush was real. I started simple, just a journaling interface, but then the feature creep hit (in the healthiest way possible). Then I threw in emotional insights <span style="color: #3b82f6;"><em>(because apparently, I\'m into feelings now)</em></span>. Next came an AI chat agent that let you talk through your emotions, pick your preferred style whether that\'s CBT style structure <span style="color: #3b82f6;"><em>(think tough-love life coach)</em></span>, stochastic self-discovery mode <span style="color: #3b82f6;"><em>(a slightly chaotic philosopher)</em></span>, or just a chatty best friend and it actually remembered what you said. Or maybe it remembered too much.</p>\n\n    <p><span style="color: #3b82f6;"><strong>Think: Therapy, if it came with toggle switches, data logs, and an interface that didn\'t judge your coping mechanisms.</strong></span></p>\n\n    <p>I wrapped everything up with a minimalist dashboard because, let\'s face it, everything looks cooler on a dashboard. And of course, you get numbers, because let\'s be honest, my engineer brain understands <span style="color: #3b82f6;"><em>"3.2 average mood score with a 67% spike in existential dread"</em></span> way better than some vague <span style="color: #3b82f6;"><em>"I\'m feeling kinda off today."</em></span> It\'s like having an observant co-founder who not only reads between the lines, but graphs them too.</p>\n\n    <p>Three hours in, powered by caffeine, stubbornness and 2 AM debugging, I actually had something working. Not perfect. Not revolutionary. But real. But it felt strangely meaningful. And I was amazed that for the first time in forever, my brain willingly stayed focused for three whole hours.</p>\n\n    <p>At the end of the day, this random project became more than just code. It reminded me why I started building in the first place. The chaos, the confusion, the moments where you yell at your screen <span style="color: #3b82f6;"><em>(and have a minor breakdown)</em></span> only to realize that stupid semicolon was missing. It\'s silly, it\'s chaotic but honestly it\'s fun.</p>\n\n    <p>So yeah, this three hour sprint brought me back to that feeling I hadn\'t felt in a while, the one where the code flows, the caffeine kicks in, and suddenly I remember why I fell in love with building things in the first place. And what really surprised me was how oddly satisfying it was to build something this quick. It felt like one of those tiny steps that don\'t look like much from the outside, but deep down, they shift something. Maybe it\'s useful. At least to me. And maybe, just maybe, a few other geeks out there who believe that the only way to truly process emotions is through a graph, a dashboard, and a timestamped log of your mental breakdowns.</p>\n\n    <p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/navneetha-rajan/MindMate" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-accent hover:text-accent-dark underline">Github</a></p>\n  '},{id:"microservices",title:"Building Scalable Microservices with Spring Boot",excerpt:"Breaking down the monolith",date:"Jun 8, 2024",readTime:"7 min read",content:"\n    <p>Content for microservices blog...</p>\n  "},{id:"aws-optimization",title:"Optimizing AWS Infrastructure for Cost and Performance",excerpt:"When every penny counts",date:"Oct 22, 2023",readTime:"8 min read",content:"\n    <p>Content for AWS optimization blog...</p>\n  "},{id:"cloud-native-future",title:"The Future of Cloud-Native Development",excerpt:"Where we're headed next",date:"Jan 3, 2024",readTime:"9 min read",content:"\n    <p>Content for cloud-native future blog...</p>\n  "}];var y=()=>{let[e,t]=(0,h.useState)(!1);(0,h.useEffect)(()=>{let e=()=>{t(window.scrollY>50)};return window.addEventListener("scroll",e),()=>window.removeEventListener("scroll",e)},[]);let n=e=>{let t=document.getElementById(e);t&&t.scrollIntoView({behavior:"smooth"})};return(0,i.jsx)(a.E.nav,{className:"fixed top-0 left-0 right-0 z-50 transition-all duration-300 ".concat(e?"bg-white/90 backdrop-blur-md shadow-lg dark:bg-gray-900/90":"bg-transparent"),initial:{y:-100},animate:{y:0},transition:{duration:.5},children:(0,i.jsx)("div",{className:"container-max",children:(0,i.jsxs)("div",{className:"flex items-center justify-between h-16",children:[(0,i.jsx)(a.E.div,{className:"text-xl font-bold text-accent cursor-pointer",onClick:()=>n("hero"),whileHover:{scale:1.05},transition:{duration:.2},children:"Navneetha Rajan"}),(0,i.jsx)("div",{className:"hidden md:flex items-center space-x-8",children:[{id:"about",label:"About"},{id:"experience",label:"Experience"},{id:"projects",label:"Projects"},{id:"blogs",label:"Blogs"},{id:"education",label:"Education"},{id:"testimonials",label:"Testimonials"},{id:"contact",label:"Contact"}].map(e=>(0,i.jsx)(a.E.button,{onClick:()=>n(e.id),className:"text-muted hover:text-accent transition-all duration-200 font-medium px-4 py-2 rounded-lg hover:bg-accent/10 hover:shadow-md",whileHover:{scale:1.05},whileTap:{scale:.95},transition:{duration:.2},children:e.label},e.id))}),(0,i.jsx)(a.E.button,{className:"md:hidden p-2 rounded-lg hover:bg-gray-100 dark:hover:bg-gray-800 transition-colors",whileHover:{scale:1.05},whileTap:{scale:.95},children:(0,i.jsx)("svg",{className:"w-6 h-6",fill:"none",stroke:"currentColor",viewBox:"0 0 24 24",children:(0,i.jsx)("path",{strokeLinecap:"round",strokeLinejoin:"round",strokeWidth:2,d:"M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16"})})})]})})})};function b(){let[e,t]=(0,h.useState)(null),n=[{icon:s.Z,href:"https://github.com/navneetha-rajan",label:"GitHub"},{icon:r,href:"https://www.linkedin.com/in/navneetha-rajan",label:"LinkedIn"},{icon:o,href:"https://x.com/navneetha_rajan",label:"X (Twitter)"},{icon:c,href:"mailto:connectwithnavneetha08@gmail.com",label:"Email"},{icon:d,href:"https://leetcode.com/u/navneetha_rajan",label:"LeetCode"}];return(0,i.jsxs)("main",{className:"min-h-screen",children:[(0,i.jsx)(y,{}),(0,i.jsx)("section",{id:"hero",className:"min-h-screen flex items-center justify-center section-padding pt-16",children:(0,i.jsx)("div",{className:"container-max text-center",children:(0,i.jsxs)(a.E.div,{initial:{opacity:0,y:20},animate:{opacity:1,y:0},transition:{duration:.8},children:[(0,i.jsx)(a.E.div,{className:"mb-8 flex justify-center",initial:{opacity:0,scale:.8},animate:{opacity:1,scale:1},transition:{duration:.8,delay:.2},children:(0,i.jsx)("div",{className:"relative",children:(0,i.jsx)("div",{className:"w-40 h-40 sm:w-48 sm:h-48 lg:w-56 lg:h-56 rounded-full bg-gradient-to-br from-accent to-accent-light flex items-center justify-center shadow-lg p-1",children:(0,i.jsx)("img",{src:"/neetz-profile.png",alt:"Navneetha Rajan",className:"w-full h-full rounded-full object-cover"})})})}),(0,i.jsxs)("h1",{className:"mb-8",children:["Hi, I'm ",(0,i.jsx)("span",{className:"gradient-text",children:"Navneetha Rajan"})]}),(0,i.jsx)("p",{className:"text-large text-muted mb-8 max-w-2xl mx-auto leading-relaxed",children:"I love building technology solutions that work smoothly, scale easily, and genuinely help people, always looking for ways to make things faster and better.
